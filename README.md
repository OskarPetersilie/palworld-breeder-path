# palworld-breeder-path

I already made a post about a possible breeding path for Helzephyr (Cryolinx) . https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/19fa10d/helzephyr_cryolinx_breeding_path/

This took quite some time and i wanted to build a tool where you can select your available Pals and your target pal. And the tool shows you a graphic of an breeding path.

Today i build this tool. it is super early access. Some quality of life features maybe get added.

If you want to make sure my tool calculated everything right you can check the breeding path with this tool. https://palworldtrainer.com/breed-calculator ( I did some QA and tests myself)
